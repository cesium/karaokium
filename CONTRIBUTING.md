# ðŸš€ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

## ðŸ“¥ Prerequisites

The following software is required to be installed on your system:

- [Erlang 24+](https://www.erlang.org/downloads)
- [Elixir 1.13+](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

We recommend using [asdf version manager][asdf-vm] to install and manage all
the programming languages' requirements.

## ðŸ‘½ Third-party dependencies

This project uses the [Spotify
API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) for adding new
songs. You need to create an App to interact with it in development
[here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

## ðŸ”§ Setup

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:cesium/karaokium.git
cd karaokium
```

Then, run the setup script to get all dependencies configured. The default
value for `ENV` is `dev`.

```
bin/setup [ENV]
```

Then you should change the `.env.dev` file as needed. Run this script again
if needed.

## ðŸ”¨ Development

Start the development server and then you can visit `http://localhost:4000`
from your browser.

```
mix phx.server # or iex -S mix phx.server
```

Lint your code.

```
bin/lint
```

Format your code.

```
bin/format
```
